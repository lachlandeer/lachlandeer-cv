# TEACHING

*Associate Professor, Mathematics, Vassar* \hfill 1931--1941

> Teach students about math, began career in programming and largely developed design and implementation of a computer compiler.

*Director, Navy Programming Languages Group* \hfill 1967--1977

> She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy. Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network. She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
